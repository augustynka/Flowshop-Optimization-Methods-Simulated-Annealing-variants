## Advanced Flow Shop Optimization Methods: Simulated Annealing Variants

This repository hosts a detailed report on advanced meta-heuristic techniques for the two-machine Flow Shop scheduling problem with no-wait constraints and service interruptions (F2, hT2 | no-wait | Lmax). The PDF presents:

- Mathematical modeling of the scheduling problem  
- Four Simulated Annealing (SA) variants (basic SA, reheating, EDD initialization, and combined EDD + reheating)  
- Comparative analysis of performance across different problem sizes and parameters  
- Experimental results, charts, and key observation
